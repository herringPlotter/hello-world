# hello-world

I've been dubbed M by my friends. I'm a brand new beginning programmer,trying to follow in the steps of my father and grandfather in general coding and web design. I'm planning on focusing on the different versions of C, Javascript, Html, and Python. As of joining github, I know next to nothing.

I'm a longtime Homestuck fan, and I volunteer at aquariums whenever I can.
